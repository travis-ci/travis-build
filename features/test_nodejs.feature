Feature: Testing a Node.js project

  Background:
   Given the following test payload
     | repository | travis-ci/travis-ci                                              |
     | commit     | 1234567                                                          |
     | config     | language: node_js, node_js: 0.6.1, env: FOO=foo, npm_args: --dev |

  Scenario: A successful build with default Node version
   Given the following test payload
     | repository | travis-ci/travis-ci                              |
     | commit     | 1234567                                          |
     | config     | language: node_js, env: FOO=foo, npm_args: --dev |
    When it starts a job
    Then it exports the given environment variables
     And it successfully clones the repository to the build dir with git
     And it successfully checks out the commit with git to the repository directory
     And it exports the line TRAVIS_NODE_VERSION=0.4
     And it successfully switches to the node.js version: 0.4
     And it announces active node version
     And it does not find the file package.json
     And it successfully runs the script: make test
     And it closes the ssh session
     And it returns the state :passed
     And it has captured the following events
