Feature: Testing a Scala project

  Background:
   Given the following test payload
     | repository | travis-ci/travis-ci                         |
     | commit     | 1234567                                     |
     | config     | language: scala, scala: 2.9.1, env: FOO=foo |

  Scenario: A successful build with ./project directory in the repository root
    When it starts a job
    Then it exports the given environment variables
     And it successfully clones the repository to the build dir with git
     And it successfully checks out the commit with git to the repository directory
     And it exports the line TRAVIS_JDK_VERSION=default
     And it exports the line TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION=2.9.1
     And it successfully switches to the jdk version: default
     And it announces active jdk version
     # think ./project
     And it finds directory project
     And it successfully runs the script: sbt ++2.9.1 test
     And it closes the ssh session
     And it returns the state :passed
     And it has captured the following events
