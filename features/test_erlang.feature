Feature: Testing an Erlang project
  Background:
   Given the following test payload
     | repository | travis-ci/travis-ci                                 |
     | commit     | 1234567                                             |
     | config     | language: erlang, otp_release: R15B, env: FOO=foo   |

  Scenario: A successful build with the default OTP release
   Given the following test payload
     | repository | travis-ci/travis-ci            |
     | commit     | 1234567                        |
