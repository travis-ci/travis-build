Feature: Testing a Groovy project

  Background:
   Given the following test payload
     | repository | travis-ci/travis-ci                           |
     | commit     | 1234567                                       |
     | config     | language: groovy, jdk: openjdk6, env: FOO=foo |

  Scenario: A successful build with Gradle
    When it starts a job
    Then it exports the given environment variables
     And it successfully clones the repository to the build dir with git
     And it successfully checks out the commit with git to the repository directory
     And it exports the line TRAVIS_JDK_VERSION=openjdk6
     And it successfully switches to the jdk version: openjdk6
     And it announces active jdk version
     And it finds the file build.gradle
     And it successfully installs dependencies with gradle
     And it successfully runs the script: gradle check
     And it closes the ssh session
     And it returns the state :passed
     And it has captured the following events
