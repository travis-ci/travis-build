    # Constructs a Build and should not be used directly. Will be instantiated
    # and used in `Travis::Build.create` which is intended to be the public API.
    #
    # The factory knows about basically all the classes used in Travis::Build
    # and will wire them up for us and pass them down to constructors. I.e. it
    # centralizes all knowledge about dependencies. This pattern of "having a
    # central fat factory" at "boundaries" within our domain model is used in
    # both travis-worker and travis-build and makes it easy to pass down mock
    # objects in tests instead of real dependencies.
    #
    # In other words the constraint is to not use class names (i.e. instantiate
    # objects within domain models). On the other hand we don't want to use a
    # DI mechanism either.
