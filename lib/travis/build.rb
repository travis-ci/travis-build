module Travis

  # Encapsulates a build that is run on a worker. Build is both used for
  # running a Job::Configure as well as a base class for Build::Remote which
  # runs a Job::Test in a VM.
  #
  # Implements a simple observer pattern to notify observers about state
  # changes and stream log output.
  #
  # A Build takes an event factory which knows how to create events and a
  # job.
  #
  # TODO passing the event factory seems quite odd, doesn't it? Maybe we
  # could just have a Context which is notified?
  #
  # TODO using Build both as a concrete class (for running configure jobs)
  # and as a base class for Build::Remote (which runs test and potentially
  # other jobs) seems odd. Maybe move to Runner::Local and Runner::Remote
  # or similar.
